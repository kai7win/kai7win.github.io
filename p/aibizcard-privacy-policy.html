    <h1>AIBizCard App - Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: October 19, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures regarding the AIBizCard App and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.</p>

    <div class="aibizcard-section">
        <h2>Business Card Recognition and AI Processing</h2>
        
        <div class="privacy-highlight">
            <p><strong>Complete Privacy Guarantee:</strong> AIBizCard App is designed with your privacy as our top priority. We DO NOT collect, store, transmit, or share any of your data.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Camera and Image Processing</h3>
        <p>To provide business card recognition functionality, our app requires access to your device's camera. We use advanced AI models to analyze business cards and extract contact information.</p>
        
        <p><strong>100% On-Device Processing:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>All AI models run entirely on your device</li>
            <li>Business card recognition is performed offline</li>
            <li>No internet connection required for core functionality</li>
            <li>All processing happens locally on your iPhone/iPad</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="privacy-highlight">
            <p><strong>Zero Data Collection:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Photo Storage:</strong> We do not save, store, or keep any photos of your business cards</li>
                <li><strong>No Contact Data Collection:</strong> Extracted contact information is not transmitted to our servers</li>
                <li><strong>No Analytics:</strong> We do not collect usage data or analytics</li>
                <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> We do not track your behavior or app usage patterns</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>When you scan a business card:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The camera captures the image temporarily in device memory</li>
            <li>Our offline AI model processes the image to recognize text and layout</li>
            <li>Contact information is extracted and displayed to you</li>
            <li>The temporary image is immediately discarded from memory</li>
            <li>You can choose to save the contact information to your device's Contacts app</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="privacy-highlight">
            <p><strong>No Data Transmission:</strong> At no point during this process is any data sent to external servers, third parties, or our company. Everything happens entirely within your device.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Contact Storage</h3>
        <p>If you choose to save extracted contact information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data is saved directly to your device's built-in Contacts app</li>
            <li>We use Apple's standard Contacts framework</li>
            <li>This data remains under your control and Apple's privacy policies</li>
            <li>We do not have access to your saved contacts</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
